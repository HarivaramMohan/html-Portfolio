<h1>The Best Movies According to Mohan</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 Movies of All time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>RRR</h3>
<p>
  I love this movie because this is a tale of two legendary revolutionaries and
  their journey far away from home. <br />
  After their journey they return home to start fighting back against British
  colonialists in the 1920s.
</p>
<h3>Ala Vaikuntapuramulo</h3>
<p>
  Viewer won't have any expectations about story or it's twists but still you do
  not feel like moving out of your chair for not even a minute. The Dialouges r
  very good with indepth meaning. <br />
  All Arjun—His energy is infectious. Bunny —is the Sunshine of the movie!
  Fights--they r simply thrilling. May be first-time in the history of Telugu
  movie nor the Routine ones or smashing Sumos.
</p>
<h3>Maharshi</h3>
<p>
  This movie shows us about the impartance of farmars.We slowly learn his
  inspiration and motives and why he is so focused on becoming successful.
  <br />
  He faces certain emotional hurdles in this journey of his but his
  determination to get successful challenges him to take some bold decisions,
  which he does and reaches the position where he is right now.
